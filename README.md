# StackOverflow-Survey

## Software Requirements and packages
This project was created using a jupyter notebook, python 3.6 and the following python libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas

## Motivation
In this project, I investigate the reliability of StackOverflow by looking at the qualifications of the users as well as their current employment status. The assumption being, that if StackOverflow has a lot of professional developers and high percentage of formally educated individuals, the answers are more likely to be accurate and of a higher quality.

## Files
There are three main files: 
### survey_results_schema.csv
This containts the questions posed to the users. This is not really used in the analysis, but gives an overall view of the questions.
### survey_results_public.csv
This contains the survey: questions and answers. This is the file used for the analysis

### survey.ipynb
This is the jupyter notebook that contains the analysis.

## Results
The conclusion is that StackOverflow has a high percentage of formally educated individuals (mostly in computer science/software engineering), as well as professional developers. Therefore, there is a good probability that the answers given to the questions (provided that these users are active) are accurate or at least of good quality.
